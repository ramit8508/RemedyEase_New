# üé§ Microphone Feature Troubleshooting Guide

## Why Microphone Works Locally But Not in Deployment

### 1. **HTTPS Requirement** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Problem**: Web browsers require HTTPS for microphone access (security policy)
- **Local**: Works on `localhost` (exception to HTTPS rule)
- **Deployment**: MUST use HTTPS
- **Solution**: 
  - ‚úÖ Vercel automatically provides HTTPS
  - ‚úÖ Ensure your custom domain has SSL certificate
  - ‚úÖ Check that `https://` is in the URL (not `http://`)

### 2. **Browser Permissions** üîí
- **Problem**: Users must grant microphone permission
- **Solution**:
  1. Click the lock icon (üîí) in browser address bar
  2. Find "Microphone" setting
  3. Change to "Allow"
  4. Refresh the page

### 3. **Browser Compatibility** üåê
- **Best Support**: Chrome, Edge (Chromium-based)
- **Good Support**: Safari (iOS/macOS)
- **Limited Support**: Firefox
- **Not Supported**: Internet Explorer

### 4. **Background Noise Issues** üîä

#### Common Causes:
- **Ambient noise**: Traffic, people talking, music
- **Echo**: Sound bouncing in room
- **Poor microphone**: Low-quality or far from speaker
- **Network issues**: Unstable internet connection

#### Solutions:
‚úÖ **Environment**:
- Use a quiet room
- Close windows/doors
- Turn off TV/music
- Move away from fans/AC units

‚úÖ **Microphone Technique**:
- Position 6-12 inches from mouth
- Speak directly toward microphone
- Use headset/external mic for better quality
- Avoid covering phone/laptop mic with hand

‚úÖ **Speaking Style**:
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Don't whisper or shout
- Pause briefly between sentences
- Articulate words (especially medical terms)

‚úÖ **Technical**:
- Use Chrome or Edge browser
- Ensure stable internet (WiFi or cellular)
- Close other apps using microphone
- Restart browser if issues persist

### 5. **Recognition Stops Unexpectedly** ‚è∏Ô∏è
- **Problem**: Recognition auto-stops after silence
- **Solution**: Our code now auto-restarts recognition
- **User Action**: Keep speaking or click Stop and restart

### 6. **Deployment-Specific Issues** üöÄ

#### Check These:
1. **Vercel Configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "headers": [
       {
         "key": "Permissions-Policy",
         "value": "microphone=(self)"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all API keys are set in Vercel dashboard

3. **Domain Issues**: Custom domains must have valid SSL

4. **Regional Restrictions**: Some regions may block certain APIs

### 7. **Testing Checklist** ‚úÖ

Before deploying, test:
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] Microphone permission prompt appears
- [ ] Permission is saved after granting
- [ ] Recognition starts when clicking mic button
- [ ] Text appears in real-time (interim results)
- [ ] Final text is saved when speaking stops
- [ ] Multiple recordings work consecutively
- [ ] Different languages work correctly
- [ ] Mobile devices work (iOS/Android Chrome)

### 8. **Error Messages** ‚ùå

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `not-allowed` | Permission denied | Grant microphone access in browser settings |
| `no-speech` | No voice detected | Speak louder, reduce noise, check mic |
| `network` | Internet issue | Check connection, try again |
| `aborted` | User stopped | Normal - no action needed |
| `audio-capture` | Mic unavailable | Close other apps using mic |
| `not-found` | No microphone | Check hardware connection |

### 9. **Mobile Considerations** üì±

#### iOS (Safari):
- Works on iOS 14.3+
- Requires HTTPS
- May need user to tap screen first (user gesture)

#### Android (Chrome):
- Works well on Android 7+
- Ensure Chrome app permissions include microphone
- Check system-level microphone permissions

### 10. **Debug Mode** üîç

To see what's happening:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for console.log messages:
   - "Speech confidence: X" (0-1, higher is better)
   - Error messages with details
3. Low confidence (<0.7) = poor audio quality/noise

### 11. **Performance Tips** ‚ö°

- **Language Selection**: Choose correct language for better accuracy
- **Medical Terms**: Speak slowly for complex medical terminology
- **Short Phrases**: Recognition works better with shorter utterances
- **Review**: Always review transcribed text before submitting

### 12. **When It Still Doesn't Work** üÜò

Try this checklist:
1. ‚úÖ Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. ‚úÖ Clear browser cache and cookies
3. ‚úÖ Try incognito/private browsing mode
4. ‚úÖ Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
5. ‚úÖ Check microphone works in other apps
6. ‚úÖ Update browser to latest version
7. ‚úÖ Restart device
8. ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors

## For Developers üë®‚Äçüíª

### Code Improvements Made:

1. **HTTPS Check**: Added validation for secure connection
2. **Auto-restart**: Recognition continues after interruptions
3. **Better Error Handling**: Specific messages for each error type
4. **Confidence Logging**: Monitor speech recognition quality
5. **Multiple Alternatives**: Better accuracy with maxAlternatives=3
6. **Explicit Permissions**: Request getUserMedia before starting
7. **Language Updates**: Dynamic language switching
8. **User Feedback**: Visual indicators and helpful tips

### Testing in Production:

```bash
# Test on actual device/network conditions
# Use Chrome DevTools Network throttling
# Test with different noise levels
# Test on mobile devices
# Monitor console for confidence scores
```

### Future Improvements:
- Add noise cancellation libraries
- Implement audio level monitoring
- Add voice activity detection (VAD)
- Support offline fallback
- Add speech synthesis for responses
