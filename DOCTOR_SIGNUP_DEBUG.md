# Doctor Signup Debug - Issues Fixed

## ðŸ”§ Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Password Confirmation Hashing Issue**
**Problem**: The `confirmPassword` field was being hashed in a separate pre-save hook, which broke validation.
**Fix**: Modified the password pre-save hook to remove `confirmPassword` after hashing the main password.

```javascript
// Before (BROKEN)
DoctorSchema.pre("save", async function (next) {
  if (!this.isModified("confirmPassword")) return next();
  this.confirmPassword = await bcrypt.hash(this.confirmPassword, 10);
  next();
});

// After (FIXED)
DoctorSchema.pre("save", async function (next) {
  if (!this.isModified("password")) return next();
  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, 10);
  this.confirmPassword = undefined; // Remove before saving
  next();
});
```

### 2. **JWT Environment Variable Typos**
**Problem**: The model was looking for `ACESS_TOKEN_SECRET` (typo) but `.env` had `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`.
**Fix**: Corrected the environment variable names in the model.

```javascript
// Before (BROKEN)
process.env.ACESS_TOKEN_SECRET

// After (FIXED)
process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
```

### 3. **Missing Upload Directory**
**Problem**: The `public/temp` directory for file uploads didn't exist.
**Fix**: Created the required directory structure.

### 4. **Better Error Logging**
**Problem**: No detailed logging made debugging difficult.
**Fix**: Added comprehensive console logging throughout the signup process.

### 5. **Password Validation**
**Problem**: Password and confirmPassword validation was only in the model.
**Fix**: Added explicit validation in the controller before saving.
