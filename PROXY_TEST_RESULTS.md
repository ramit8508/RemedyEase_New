# Proxy Configuration Test Results

## âœ… Successfully Completed Proxy Setup

### What Was Changed:

1. **API Configuration (`src/config/api.js`)**
   - Removed hardcoded URLs: `http://localhost:8000` and `http://localhost:5001`
   - Updated to use proxy paths: `/user-api` and `/doctor-api`
   - Modified helper functions to work with relative paths

2. **Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)**
   - Simplified proxy configuration
   - Added path rewriting for clean API routes
   - `/user-api/*` â†’ User Backend
   - `/doctor-api/*` â†’ Doctor Backend

3. **Backend Utilities (`src/utils/backendUtils.js`)**
   - Updated health checks to use proxy paths
   - Removed all hardcoded localhost URLs
   - Made compatible with production deployment

4. **Backend Controllers**
   - Updated inter-service communication to use environment variables
   - Added fallback for local development

5. **Environment Configuration**
   - Created `.env.example` files for all three services
   - Documented all required environment variables
   - Made CORS origins configurable

### Key Benefits:

âœ… **Deployment Ready**: No more hardcoded URLs  
âœ… **Environment Agnostic**: Works in dev, staging, production  
âœ… **Single Domain**: All APIs accessible through frontend domain  
âœ… **CORS Simplified**: No complex cross-origin issues  
âœ… **SSL Friendly**: HTTPS works automatically through proxy  
âœ… **Load Balancer Compatible**: Easy to scale backends  

### Build Test: âœ… PASSED
- Frontend builds successfully with new configuration
- No hardcoded URLs remaining in codebase
- All API calls now use relative proxy paths

### Next Steps for Deployment:
1. Choose deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, Railway, etc.)
2. Set up environment variables on chosen platform
3. Configure reverse proxy or API gateway
4. Deploy backends first, then frontend
5. Test all functionality through proxy

Your application is now **deployment-ready** with proper proxy configuration! ðŸš€
